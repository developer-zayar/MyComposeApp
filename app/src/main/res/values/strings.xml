    <string name="article_title">Jetpack Compose Tutorial</string>
    <string name="article_first_text">Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. Compose simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.</string>
    <string name="article_second_text">In this tutorial, you build a simple UI component with declarative functions. You call Compose functions to say what elements you want and the Compose compiler does the rest. Compose is built around Composable functions. These functions let you define your app\\\'s UI programmatically because they let you describe how it should look and provide data dependencies, rather than focus on the process of the UI\\\'s construction, such as initializing an element and then attaching it to a parent. To create a Composable function, you add the @Composable annotation to the function name.</string>

    <string name="girl_with_pearl_desc">Girl with a Pearl Earring (Dutch: Meisje met de parel) is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer, dated c. 1665. Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present title towards the end of the 20th century because of the earring worn by the girl portrayed there.[3] The work has been in the collection of the Mauritshuis in The Hague since 1902 and has been the subject of various literary and cinematic treatments.</string>
    <string name="the_persistence_of_memory_desc">The Persistence of Memory (Catalan: La persistència de la memòria, Spanish: La persistencia de la memoria) is a 1931 painting by artist Salvador Dalí and one of the most recognizable works of Surrealism. First shown at the Julien Levy Gallery in 1932, since 1934 the painting has been in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, which received it from an anonymous donor. It is widely recognized and frequently referred to in popular culture,[1] and sometimes referred to by more descriptive titles, such as \"The Melting Clocks\", \"The Soft Watches\" or \"The Melting Watches\".</string>
    <string name="the_scream_desc">The Scream is an art composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893. The Norwegian name of the piece is Skrik (\'Scream\'), and the German title under which it was first exhibited is Der Schrei der Natur (\'The Scream of Nature\'). The agonized face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images in art, seen as symbolizing the anxiety of the human condition. Munch\'s work, including The Scream, had a formative influence on the Expressionist movement.</string>
    <string name="mona_lisa_desc">The Mona Lisa[a] is a half-length portrait painting by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance,[4][5] it has been described as \"the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, [and] the most parodied work of art in the world.\"[6] The painting\'s novel qualities include the subject\'s enigmatic expression,[7] monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism.</string>
    <string name="starry_night_desc">The Starry Night, often called simply Starry Night, is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village.[1][2] It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941,[3] acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. Described as a \"touchstone of modern art\", The Starry Night has been regarded as one of the most recognizable paintings in the Western canon.</string>
